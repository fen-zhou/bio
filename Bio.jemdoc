Since September 2018, Fen Zhou is working as an Associate Professor at the Institut Superieur d'Electronique de Paris (on-leave from the Avignon University), France. Before that, he has been an Associate Professor at the LIA lab of the 
Avignon University, France from 2012 to 2018. He obtained the HDR from Avignon University in 2018 and his PhD from INSA of Rennes in 2010. His 
Ph.D thesis was jointly supervised by Prof. [http://www.irisa.fr/prive/bcousin/personal-info.html Bernard Cousin] and Prof. [http://www.lirmm.fr/~molnar/MMang.html Miklos 
Molnar]. Between 2010 and 2012, he was with the computer science department of IMT Atlantique (ex Telecom Bretagne) as a post-doctoral fellow, where he worked on the European FP7 CNG project and 
French Zewall project. \n \n

Dr. Zhou is a Senior Member of IEEE. He has served as a TPC Co-chair, Symposium Co-chair, Publicity Co-chairs, Local Organization Chair, and Session Chair in several International Conferences (IEEE BMSB'20, IEEE ICNC'18, IEEE WCSP'14, IEEE Wimob'15/19, NetgCOOP'16, IEEE MovNet'17, IEEE Globecom'13 ect.). He has also served on the program committees for several international conferences such as IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE GLOBECOM, IEEE ONDM, and IEEE IWCMC. From
Sept. 2016, he is awarded the French Research Bonus (PEDR) for a period of four years.
