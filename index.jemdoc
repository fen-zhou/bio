Fen Zhou is a Full Professor at IMT Lille Douai, Institut Mines-Télécom, France. Prior to that, he was an Associate Professor  at the LIA lab of the Avignon University (France) from 2012 to 2018 and then at Institut Superieur d'Electronique de Paris (ISEP) until 08\/2020. He obtained the HDR from Avignon University in 2018 and his PhD from INSA of Rennes in 2010. His 
Ph.D thesis was jointly supervised by Prof. [http://www.irisa.fr/prive/bcousin/personal-info.html Bernard Cousin] and Prof. [http://www.lirmm.fr/~molnar/MMang.html Miklos 
Molnar]. Between 2010 and 2012, he was with the computer science department of IMT Atlantique (ex Telecom Bretagne) as a post-doc. In the past ten years, he has cordinated or co-cordinated several research projets in the national or international levels, such as PHC Cai Yuanpei, Campus France Eiffel Scholarship, Science Sans Frontiers, Campus France Profas B+,  PACA Regional project, LIA lab project, Open project of Shanghai Jiaotong University. He has also been  involed in the European FP7 CNG project, Zewall project, Vaucluse \@muse project. \n \n

Dr. Zhou is a Senior Member of IEEE. He has served as a TPC Co-chair, Symposium Co-chair, Publicity Co-chairs, Local Organization Chair, and Session Chair in several International Conferences (IEEE BMSB'20, IEEE ICNC'18, IEEE WCSP'14, IEEE Wimob'15/19, NetgCOOP'16, IEEE MovNet'17, IEEE Globecom'13, IEEE Mascots'19 ect.). He has also served on the program committees for several international conferences such as IEEE INFOCOM, IEEE GLOBECOM, IEEE ONDM, and IEEE IWCMC. From
Sept. 2016, he is awarded the French Research Bonus (PEDR) for a period of four years.
